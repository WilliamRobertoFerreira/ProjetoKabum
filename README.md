# How to use?
By default this code come for Chrome browser users, if you want to change that for Firefox browser you can comment the lines 57 and 58 with an hashtag in the initial letters of the code and remove the hashtag in the initinal lines 61 and 62.

I personaly don't recommend to use in firefox because it is unstable for selenium and the option "back to the last page" sometimes doens't work.
